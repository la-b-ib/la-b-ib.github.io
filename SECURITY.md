## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

**Preferred Method:**
1. Open a [new security advisory](https://github.com/la-b-ib/la-b-ib.github.io/security/advisories/new) in this repository
2. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Specify any potential impact

**Alternative Method (for sensitive issues):**
Email: [labib.45x@gmail.com ](mailto:labib.45x@gmail.com)  
(Please use "Security Vulnerability" in the subject line)

### What to Include in Your Report
- Description of the vulnerability
- URL/path where the vulnerability exists
- Browser/device information if relevant
- Screenshots or proof-of-concept code (if available)
- Suggested fix (optional)

## Response Time

I will make every effort to:
- Acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days
- Provide a preliminary assessment within 7 business days
- Keep you informed of progress toward a fix
- Publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Vulnerability Handling Process

1. **Verification**: I will verify the reported vulnerability
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity using CVSS scoring
3. **Fix Development**: Create and test a fix
4. **Deployment**: Release the fix in the main branch
5. **Disclosure**: Document the vulnerability in SECURITY.md (if appropriate)

## Security Considerations

### Known Security Measures
- All form submissions are sanitized and validated
- No sensitive user data is stored persistently
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are implemented
- HTTPS is enforced for all connections

### Areas of Particular Concern
- Contact form submissions (if PHP backend is used)
- Third-party library vulnerabilities (jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Insecure direct object references (if any dynamic content exists)

## Dependency Security

This project uses the following security measures for dependencies:
- Regular updates via GitHub Dependabot
- Manual review of all third-party libraries
- Removal of unused dependencies
- Pinned versions for all dependencies

To check for vulnerable dependencies:
```bash
npm audit
```

## Secure Development Practices

### Coding Standards
- Input validation on all form fields
- Output encoding for dynamic content
- Principle of least privilege for any backend functionality
- Secure headers in responses
- Regular dependency updates

### Recommended Security Tools
- [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/) for security headers scan
- [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) for dependency scanning
- [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) for vulnerability scanning

## Disclosure Policy

Vulnerabilities will be disclosed:
- After a fix is available
- In the project's SECURITY.md file
- With appropriate credit to the reporter (unless anonymity requested)

## Limitations

As a static website:
- No server-side processing (except contact form if enabled)
- Limited attack surface
- No user authentication system
- No database connections

However, client-side vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.) are still possible.

## Acknowledgements

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be acknowledged here unless they prefer to remain anonymous.
